Real-time tactics game with pause mechanics that allow you to execute handplaced strategies with a squad of inflitration specialists. I worked on the game's mission preview screen, tutorial system, enemy reinforcements, editor tools and debugging tools.

    <h5>Mission Preview Screen</h5>
    <p>I implemented this screen that gives the player a preview of a mission's level layout and allows the player to place pins to plan the route they will take for a mission. This screen also allows them to determine the spawning position of their squad pre-"hack" certain elements in the level (like doors and consoles) to make their route easier as their squad traverses the level.</p>

##### Tutorial System

I implemented a configurable tutorial system that allows any designer or programmer to script a sequence of changes to objects in the game without having to touch code. The sequence is represented in a behavior tree with custom nodes built on top of Behavior Designer so that anyone editing the tutorial can make changes to the sequence of tutorial events with ease.

##### Enemy Reinforcements

Spawns waves of enemies periodically. I created configuration files that will allow a designer to set spawning intervals and to set up "spawn wave archetypes" that will determine the kind of enemies that would spawn with each wave, as well as a level setup tool to determine the spawn location of enemy reinforcements.

##### Squad Spawning Locations and Individual Positioning

A tool that will allow a designer to hand-place the spawning position of each squad member when a player's squad is spawned at the start of a mission. It includes gizmos/handles that a designer can just drag from within a scene to change the position and placement of each spawn position.

---

##### Scene Setup Debugging and Balancing Tools

A visual debugging tool that I made to help designers balance/optimize enemy placement, the amount and placement of defensive cover in the scene, as well as a scoring mechanism for how vulnerable a player's squad member will be in each defensive cover location.

##### Runtime Gizmo Renderer

A way for our programmers to render gizmos in builds. Normally, Unity only renders gizmos in the editor, but I wrote an API that serves as a replacement for Unity's Gizmos API that renders lines and wireframe shapes using Vectrosity.
